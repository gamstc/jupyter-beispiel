# Learning Data Science 

### A personal account of my journey from applied mathematics, through maths and computing education to data science

This will be a collection of learning materials and some personal reviews of their usability for getting into the field of data science, assuming some background in mathematics and basic principles of programming. These assumptions will be made explicit wherever they are required. 

The goal is to turn this collection into some kind of curriculum with reviews and recommendations and publish it as a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) (at some point). For now it will consist of some Jupyter Notebooks with code examples to illustrate the learning process. 

Maybe this will be useful for someone on a similar journey.
